/**
 * <p>
 * This is part 3 of 3 for fully provisioning HIS on a Windows client. This class will register an identity provisioned
 * using HisIdentityProvisioner and register that identity with an appraiser.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class utilizes a properties file. It looks for a file by the name of "HISprovisioner.properties" in the
 * directory from which Java was invoked.
 * </p>
 * The following values must be in the properties file:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>HisRegistrationUrl</b> This is the entire path to the registration service.</li>
 * <li><b>TrustStore</b> This is the name of the trust store used to encrypt the web service connection. This file must
 * be provided by the web server hosting the appraiser and placed into the path that the provisioner is run from ("./").
 * </li>
 * <li><b>ClientPath</b> This is the path for the HIS client installation. The AIC (aic.cer) must be in this directory
 * for registration to take place.</li>
 * </ul>
