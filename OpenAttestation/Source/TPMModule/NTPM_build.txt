BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

LINUX

Build requires the installation of automake, the GCC C++ compiler, and Trousers development files. On Red Hat automake and GCC C++ are normally installed by default. Trousers development files can be acquired by having yum install trousers-devel.

NIARL_TPM_Module includes a makefil and supporting files automatically generated by Eclipse. Simply type make into a terminal window after navigating to the folder in which the NIARL_TPM_Module source has been extraced. This will generate an executable suitable for your system.

Note that Trousers (tcsd) is required to be installed and operating before using the NIARL_TPM_Module.

WINDOWS

Visual Studio project files are included for Windows clients. However, the TCG TSS header files and TSS library are NOT included. The TSS header files can be acquired from the TCG's website. The TSS library must be licensed from a TSS vendor. Trousers exists on Linux as a free and open source TPM interface. No such equivalent exists on Windows. While some TSS vendors like NTru and Infineon make their software available licenses to develop against that software may require additional investment.

Visual Studio needs to know the include directory for the TSS header files and the location of the TSS development library before compilation.
